          <h2 className="text two">“Kori created a safe space for me to discuss and untangle my circumstances and reactions. She asked me questions which helped me see and understand myself, and then she followed that up with important perspectives, new ways of looking at situations and gave me tools to make new choices about my thoughts, feelings and actions.<br />
          I’ve implemented new strategies that Kori introduced into my daily life which help me think about myself with more love and respect, and that helps empower me to be able to see that I can change my thoughts- no matter the circumstances. As I feel more love and respect for myself, I notice I’m able to have more love and respect in my relationships with others.” -Elizabeth G
